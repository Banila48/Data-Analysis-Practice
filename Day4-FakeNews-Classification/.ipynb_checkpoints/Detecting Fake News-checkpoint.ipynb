    "\n",
    "TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.\n",

    "The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features."

    "\n",
    "Text data requires special preparation before you can start using it for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text must be parsed to remove words, called **tokenization**. Then the words need to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm, called feature extraction (or **vectorization**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-Words Model\n",
    "We cannot work with text directly when using machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we need to convert the text to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to perform classification of documents, so each document is an **“input”** and a class label is the **“output”** (eg. fake or true news) for our predictive algorithm. Algorithms take vectors of numbers as input, therefore we need to convert documents to fixed-length vectors of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective model for thinking about text documents in machine learning is called the Bag-of-Words Model, or BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is simple in that it throws away all of the order information in the words and focuses on the occurrence of words in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by assigning each word a unique number. Then any document we see can be encoded as a fixed-length vector with the length of the vocabulary of known words. The value in each position in the vector could be filled with a count or frequency of each word in the encoded document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the bag of words model, where we are only concerned with encoding schemes that represent what words are present or the degree to which they are present in encoded documents without any information about order.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to extend this simple method, both by better clarifying what a “word” is and in defining what to encode about each word in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides 3 different schemes that we can use, and we will briefly look at each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convert text to word count vectors with CountVectorizer**\n",
    "The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.\n",
    "- Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more documents.\n",
    "- Call the transform() function on one or more documents as needed to encode each as a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convert text to word frequency vectors with TfidfVectorizer**\n",
    "Word counts are a good starting point, but are very basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with simple counts is that some words like “the” will appear many times and their large counts will not be very meaningful in the encoded vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to calculate word frequencies, and by far the most popular method is called TF-IDF. This is an acronym than stands for “Term Frequency – Inverse Document” Frequency which are the components of the resulting scores assigned to each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.\n",
    "Without going into the math, TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TfidfVectorizer will tokenize documents, learn the vocabulary and inverse document frequency weightings, and allow you to encode new documents. Alternately, if you already have a learned CountVectorizer, you can use it with a TfidfTransformer to just calculate the inverse document frequencies and start encoding documents.\n",
