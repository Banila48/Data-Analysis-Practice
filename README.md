# üêº Data-Analysis-Practice

  - **Context + Inspiration:** I wanted to learn more about data analysis and have more hands-on experience something that my school module did not provide. I began my watching tutorials from various sources before dabbling into a few kaggle projects. 

  - _Challenges: Picking up pandas was straightforward but sometimes it was a bit tricky to filter the data. The part I enjoyed the most will be the data visualization_

  - **_Technologies used:_** Python (pandas)
