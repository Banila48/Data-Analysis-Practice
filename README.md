# 🐼 Data-Analysis-Practice

  - **Context + Inspiration:** When the pandemic first struck, a lot of my plans were interrupted. Using the free time that I had, I decided to learn more about data analysis and thus the journey started from watching youtube to dabbling into a few kaggle projects. 

  - _Challenges: Picking up pandas was straightforward but sometimes it was a bit tricky to filter the data. The part I enjoyed the most will be the data visualization_

  - **_Technologies used:_** Python (pandas)
